# mTwitch
mTwitch is a modulizer set of scripts to help conform twitch more closely to the IRC standard and to make twitch more accessible from within the mIRC enviornment

# Requirments and Dependacies
* mIRC v7.43
* Windows XP+: Due to a dependacy in the JSON parser these scripts will not work under WINE
* [JSON Parser](http://hawkee.com/snippet/10194/): Many of scripts take advantage of twitch's webapi including mTwitch.Core.mrc
* mTwitch.core.mrc is required by all other scripts here in the repo
