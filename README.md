# mTwitch
mTwitch is a modulizer set of scripts for mIRC to help conform twitch more closely to the IRC standard and to make twitch more accessible from within the mIRC enviornment

# Requirements and Dependencies
* mIRC v7.43
* Windows XP+: Due to a dependency in the JSON parser these scripts will not work under WINE
* [JSONForMirc.mrc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SReject/mTwitch/master/resources/JSONForMirc.mrc): Many of scripts take advantage of twitch's webapi including mTwitch.Core.mrc
* mTwitch.core.mrc is required by all other scripts here in the repo

# Wiki
Information about what each script does can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/SReject/mTwitch/wiki).

If you would like to help, simply clone the repo, make updates and make a pull request. Help is needed for adding features, commenting/cleaning up code and documentation via the wiki. Feel free to make pull-requests for any of the above and if applicatable I will merge the request.
