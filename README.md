# mTwitch
mTwitch is a modulizer set of scripts for mIRC to help conform twitch more closely to the IRC standard and to make twitch more accessible from within the mIRC enviornment

# Requirements and Dependencies
* mIRC v7.43
* Windows XP+: Due to a dependency in the JSON parser these scripts will not work under WINE
* [JSON Parser](http://hawkee.com/snippet/10194/): Many of scripts take advantage of twitch's webapi including mTwitch.Core.mrc
* mTwitch.core.mrc is required by all other scripts here in the repo

# Wiki
Information about what each script does can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/SReject/mTwitch/wiki).

# Help Needed
If you would like to help, simply clone the repo, make updates and make a pull request.  

Help is needed for documenting, via the wiki, what each script currently does, commenting code, and adding features. Feel free to make pull-requests for any of the above and if applicatable I will merge the request.  

# Contact
I can be contacted on Twitch in #[mirchelp](http://twitch.tv/mirchelp)'s stream, or on [SwiftIRC](irc://irc.swiftirc.net:6667/mircscripting)
